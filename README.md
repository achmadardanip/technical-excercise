# Technical Exercise Product Engineer - Enrollment Management System

This Laravel-based application manages enrollments, exams, and submissions. The API exposed to external clients currently consists of only one endpoint: `/api/user`. This README provides step-by-step setup instructions, API documentation for the available endpoint, guidance on running tests, including how to test the `DropOutEnrollments` command, and product analysis document as part of Dicoding Technical Exercise for Product Engineer.

## API Documentation

Since the current API consists of a single endpoint

Here is the documentation for /api/user:

### GET /api/user

* **Description:**
  Returns the details of the authenticated user. This endpoint is used in applications where user authentication is required, providing basic information about the logged-in user.

* **Authentication:**
  This endpoint requires an authenticated request (for example, using Laravel Sanctum or Passport). Ensure you include the necessary authentication headers (e.g., Bearer token).

* **Response Example**

  ```
  {
      "id": 1166041,
      "name": "Monalisa",
      "email": "monalisa@example.com",
      "email_verified_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z",
      "created_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z"
  }
  ```

* **Example Request**

  ```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/user \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  ```

## Testing Instructions

### Testing the API Using Postman

To test the `/api/user` endpoint using Postman, first create a new user using Tinker and generate an API token.

* **Create a New User with Tinker:**

  Open your terminal and start Tinker:

  ```
  php artisan tinker 
  ```

  Create a new user (this example uses a factory; adjust if needed):

  ```
  $user = App\Models\User::factory()->create([
      'name' => 'Monalisa',
      'email' => 'monalisa@example.com',
      'password' => bcrypt('secret'),
  ])
  ```

* **Generate an API Token (if using Laravel Sanctum or Passport):**

  For example, using Laravel Sanctum:

  ```
  $token = $user->createToken('Test Token')->plainTextToken;
  echo $token;
  ```

* **Run The Application**

  Make sure you start the application again after creating a new user, type the following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

* **Set Up Postman:**

  * Open Postman and create a new GET request to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/api/user
    ```

  * In the request headers, add token you've got from previous step:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN 
    ```

  * Click "Send" to make the request.

* **Verify the Response:**

  You should receive a JSON response like the following with the userâ€™s details (matching the newly created user).

  ```
  {
      "id": 1166041,
      "name": "Monalisa",
      "email": "monalisa@example.com",
      "email_verified_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z",
      "created_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-03-01T14:58:25.000000Z"
  }
  ```

### Testing the DropOutEnrollments Command

- **Run The Command Manually**

  In root directory of the app, run the following command:

  ```
  php artisan enrollments:dropout
  ```

  The command will output details such as the number of enrollments processed, excluded, and dropped out, along with performance metrics.
